# Simulated Annealing
###1
The SA_discrete.py solves discrete optimization problems. Hypercube coloring problem is tested.

The SA method is also tested on a fully connected cube, of which every 2 nodes are connected. 
For 3- coloring, the SA gives the best result of 7 violations; and for 4-coloring, it gives 4.
###2
The SA_continuous.py solves continuous optimization problems.
